Portable Weather Station using Arduino ProMini 3.3V, DS18B20 Temp Sensor, T5403 Barometric Pressure Sensor


This Portable Weather station will allow external Temperature, internal temperature, relative barometric pressure and altitude measurements.  All components are 3.3V powered.  RGB LED will display a color scale relative to the outdoor temperature.

Idea is to be able to take the sensor in the car or on a hike/tent camping and monitor approximate altitude, temperature in the tent/vehicle, and temperature outside the tent/vehicle as well as pressure.
